This project will be the creation of a landing page. This will allow me to practice and put into use all of my previously learned html and css knowledge and practice correct syntax.
By the end of this project I hope to be more comfortable bouncing between my css stylesheets and my html documents. This should also be a good environment for putting all of my flexbox skills to the test.
